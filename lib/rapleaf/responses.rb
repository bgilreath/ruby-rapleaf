  # Credits :
  # I learned the magic of making an OpenStruct object able to respond as a fully Enumerable
  # object (responds to .each, etc.) thanks to a great blog article on Struct and OpenStruct
  # at http://errtheblog.com/post/30
  #
  # Thanks to Sean Knapp for the XmlSimple response patch which greatly simplified the response
  # mechanism for the whole library while making it more accurate and much less brittle to boot!
